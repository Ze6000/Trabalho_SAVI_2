1. Separate table point cloud, including the objects above it, from the rest of the point cloud
    - Find table plane
        - Find all horizontal planes
        - Find their center points
        - Find floor plane - largest
        - Find center point closest to floor center (at lest 1m above it) - table center point
        - Table plane = plane to which that point belongs to
    - Create Bounding Box arround it
        - Create a bounding box arround the table center point in which the objects are included
    - Cropp bounding box from original point cloud
        - Create a table point cloud = points included in the bounding box 

2. Separate each object from the table
    - Separate objects from table
    - Cluster objects
    - Save each object point cloud

3. Project the objects in rgb image
    - Get the images taken from that scenario
    - Get the camera pose and orientation for each image
    - Project point cloud points by the camera's pose and orientation in the rbg image

4. Extract object image
    - Create a bounding box arround each projected object
    - Extract the piece of image within the object's bounding box


Class scnerio:
- Scenario point cloud
- Table point cloud
- Each object point cloud

Class object:
 - Object point cloud
 - Properties: hight, width and color
 - Center point (projected)
 - Draw bounding box feature
